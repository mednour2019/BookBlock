							<h2>My Personality</h2>
							<p>I'm Mohamed Nour Khammeri, 27 years old, from <b>Tunisia</b>, specifically from Sfax, a
								city
								located in the middle of the country. I was born in Hencha, a small town where I spent
								all my childhood. My mom is from Nabeul, situated in the touristic zone of the country,
								where I also spent some time playing with my relatives by the sea and beaches.</p>

							<p>I grew up in a family with three sisters, being the only brother. We love each other very
								much. My dad is a strict father who takes care and is interested in our behavior, while
								my mom is more focused on our education.</p>

							<p>I spent most of my time playing football in the stadium near our house. Those times were
								the best of my life. I was a brilliant student at school, considered a specialized
								pupil. This period was unbelievable; I'll never forget the times I went with my father
								to watch football matches. I prepared myself before the matches I played in the stadium.
								I wish this period would return to my life.</p>

							<p>I'll also never forget the first baccalaureate degree achieved by my big sister, which we
								celebrated in 2010. This coincided with the World Cup in South Africa, where I spent
								mornings celebrating with family and evenings watching football matches with dad.
								Football remains the biggest memory of my life.</p>

							<div class="quote">
								"Football was more than just a game for me; it was a passion that shaped my fondest
								childhood memories and strengthened the bonds with my family."

							<h2>My Educational Journey</h2>
							<p>I completed my baccalaureate degree at Hencha High School, specializing in computer
								sciences. The curriculum included courses in basic algorithms, mathematics, physics,
								Italian, Arabic, business, and English. I have fond memories of my teacher, Ms. Awatef
								Bahloul, whose sessions were always filled with jokes, smiles, and engaging algorithm
								exercises and competitions. I'm particularly proud of my performance in algorithm exams,
								where I consistently scored between 16 and 19 out of 20 GPA, often achieving the highest
								grade.</p>

							<p>Ms. Bahloul holds a special place in my heart. She treated me like her own daughter, and
								I love her as much as my mom. Although I regret not staying in touch as much as I'd like
								due to various challenges, I know she still asks about me and remains interested in my
								progress.</p>

							<p>In the national baccalaureate exam, I achieved a GPA of 11.36 out of 20. While I wasn't
								entirely satisfied with this result, I've come to understand that exams don't always
								fully evaluate a student's capabilities.</p>

							<p>Following high school, I was admitted to the University of Economic Science and
								Management of Sfax to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Management.
								Initially, I felt uncomfortable as I had to leave my family and live alone in a private
								dormitory. I had hoped to study in Nabeul, my mother's hometown, but eventually adapted
								to studying 55 km away from my hometown.</p>

							<p>This period was a mix of sad and happy moments as I learned to take care of myself,
								managing everything from clothes and laundry to meals. After three years, I completed my
								bachelor's degree with an impressive GPA of 16.550/20 for my final graduation project.
							</p>

							<p>I continued my education at the same faculty, pursuing a master's degree in Computer
								Science and Data Engineering. During this time, I met new friends and excelled
								academically, contrary to my performance during my bachelor's years. I led multiple
								academic projects with colleagues and completed my master's with a GPA of 15.50/20.</p>

							<p>I finally completed my studies in 2022, ending my student career on a high note.</p>

							<h2>Club Activitie</h2>
							<p>During my bachelor's degree, I immersed myself in various artistic events. One of my
								proudest achievements was founding the Ultra Cinema Club at the university. This
								platform allowed me to explore my passion for screenwriting and filmmaking.</p>

							<p>One of my most significant creative works was writing a screenplay centered around a
								character named Hedi. The story follows his emotional journey as he grapples with the
								mysterious disappearance of his father. Through flashbacks, the narrative explores
								Hedi's depression, regret, and eventual path to making life-changing decisions. This
								project allowed me to delve deep into character development and emotional storytelling.
							</p>

							<p>The project involved: Writing the original screenplay ,
								Organizing casting sessions for characters ,
								Creating and directing memorable story moments
							</p>





							<p>Unfortunately, like many creative projects worldwide, our activities were interrupted by
								the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing us to take a break from production.</p>

							<p>I'm currently working on developing an application to automate script and character
								management, combining my passion for filmmaking with my technical skills.</p>

							<p>Beyond filmmaking, I've ventured into music video production, working with a group of
								rappers. In this role, I:Wrote scenarios for music videos ,
								Directed photography sessions ,
								Managed video production ,</p>

								2020. This experience marked my first steps into the professional world, where I

								Collaborative teamwork </p>
